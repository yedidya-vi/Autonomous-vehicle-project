# Autonomous-vehicle-project
I am excited to present to you our autonomous car project that I worked on together with the great team of Matan Dror, Sagi Alter, and yehuda livne during the last year of study. 

In the past year, we participated in a challenging university project to create an autonomous car, our team was responsible for developing the algorithms. A variety of technologies were used (such as road detection technology, object detection, and steering wheel angle control).

During the development, we used a combination of OpenCV and TensorFlow for image processing and object detection.
Here is a video that shows how the Road detection algorithm works.

My team members and I are grateful to Ariel University for four wonderful years of study and enrichment. It was for us a warm home that enriched both our professional and personal lives.
